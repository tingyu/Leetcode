/**
Construct Binary Tree from Inorder and Postorder Traversal 

Given inorder and postorder traversal of a tree, construct the binary tree.

Note:
You may assume that duplicates do not exist in the tree.

This problem can be illustrated by using a simple example.

in-order:   4 2 5  (1)  6 7 3 8
post-order: 4 5 2  6 7 8 3  (1)
From the post-order array, we know that last element is the root. We can find the root in in-order array. 
Then we can identify the left and right sub-trees of the root from in-order array.

Using the length of left sub-tree, we can identify left and right sub-trees in post-order array. 
Recursively, we can build up the tree.
